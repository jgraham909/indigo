# About

This is a webserver written in go with [IndieWeb](http://indiewebcamp.com) principles in mind.

Currently this does not do much other than serve some static templated files.

## Current Roadmap 

1. Add capability to add notes, articles, and replies
2. Add webmention functionality
  * Include a cache of incoming parsed webmention source URLs.
  * On repeat webmentions capture a diff and only notify of changed content.
3. Add Search
4. POSSE to Twitter
5. Documentation
